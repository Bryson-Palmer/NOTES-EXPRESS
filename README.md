  Welcome to Notes Express! This is a straight forward note taking application where you can write, save, and delete notes. Use it for organizing your day, lyrical ideas, scratch pad ideas, or for just about any other reason you would want to recall a note for later. The options are infinite! This app uses express on the backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

  ## üîç <a id='future-development'></a> Future Development
  This is a very good foundation for a number of note taking variaties. One could taylor the notes app to be a more specific tool. For example, a lyrical note app with built in tools for keeping the creative flow going using a dictionary, a thesaurus, and a rhyme generator. The note app could get integrated into another app as a built in tool as well. Think of a time when you wanted to write something important down for later, and the context for which you wanted to write that note down to begin with, then think about what niche the note belongs in. You could build an app around that specifically. Creativity knows no bounds. </br>
